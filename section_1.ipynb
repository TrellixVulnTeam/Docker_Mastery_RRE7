    "Docker's \"raison d'etre\" come from frictions that were being faced relating to speed a efficiency of packaging and deploying software.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three main reason are:\n",
    "* Isolation:\n",
    "    * During the move from mainframe to servers (early 2000s), it was very rare that an app would fully utilise the capacity of the servers on which they would run. You ended up with mutliple apps colocating on the same servers, this increased complexity in managing them and made them prone to outages (e.g: one change for an app would cause an effect on other apps).\n",
    "    * This lead to the emergence of VMs (Virtual Machines), fewer apps on multiple VMs all riding on the same hosts. This would lead to an exploding number of VMs which were each spun up with their own OS. Isolation was sort of solved but complexity outweighed the benefits.\n",
    "    * Then Docker comes along and removes the need for all the different operating systems on each VM. Each application has its own namespace that is isolated and managing them comes easily through the docker/kubernetes cli. You can now run multiple version of the same app on the same host without any conflict.\n",
    "* Environment\n",
    "    * With VMs also came the deployement of a large number of types of environments. The running joke being \"Works on my machine\".\n",
    "    * The container image has become a sort of contract between what the app runs and where its running. Just like actual shipping containers where those who ship something don't care what the ship that was carrying the container looked like and the people transporting the container didn't care what was inside it.\n",
    "        * This is done through a consistent standard (the OCI format) which has two specs, an image and a runtime spec.\n",
    "        * this ensures that the container will always be run with the same consistent way and same dependencies it was built with.\n",
    "* Speed\n",
    "    * Not the speed of CPU and processors but the speed of business, the ability to test and execute on ideas in a timely manner"
